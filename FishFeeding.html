								<p>In a cleaning a mutualism, there is a cleaner that removes and consumes the ectoparasites of a client fish. In the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, goby fishes are among the most abundant cleaners on the reef. However,
								 not all cleaner gobies are the same because some rely on cleaning as a foraging strategy more than others. Thus, cleaner gobies exhibit different degrees of ecological specialization. Here, we asked whether cleaner gobies have feeding morphologies that are distinct from non-cleaner gobies. 
								 We also asked if the more obligate cleaners had more specialized morphologies than the facultative cleaners. 
								</p>
								<p>
								In general, a high specialized task requires an equally specialized tool in order to complete the task. We found this to be the case for cleaner gobies. Obligate cleaners have substantially shorter and stronger jaws than non-cleaners, 
								while facultative cleaner have an intermediate morphology. Cleaner gobies also have a comb-like dentition similar to those found in fishes that scrap algae off of rockes, suggesting that cleaner gobies may repurposed this scraping morphology for a different kind of prey.
