									Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the George Washington University in
									   <a href="https://sandykawano.weebly.com" target ="_blank">Dr. Sandy Kawano's lab</a>. I am a functional morphologist and evolutionary biologist broadly interested in the relationship between ecology and morphology, and how those patterns have evolved and diversified across vertebrates. My current research focuses on the link between habitat, morphology, and locomotion in salamanders. My other collaborations focus on fish feeding morphology, 
									   fish with suction cups, and mainland anole ecomorphology. Browse my website
									    to learn more and get updates about my research or follow me on twitter. Please get in touch if you have any questions, comments, or would like to collaborate.</h4>

								</span>
								<p>Caribbean anole lizards are popular among biologists for being a textbook example of convergent evolution. On four islands in the Caribbean, 
								anoles have repeatedly evolved groups of species (ecomorphs) with similar ecologies and morphologies. These ecomorphs demonstrate the strong relationship between habitat and morphology in 
								Caribbean anoles and have been extensively studied since they were first proposed in the late 1960s to early 1970s. However, the anole ecomorphs have really only been applied to Caribbean anoles 
								and its unclear whether their relatives in Central and South America also fit the bill. That is until now...
								</p>
								<p>We measured the body proportions of 200+ species of island and mainland anoles to investigate their morphological similarities. We took advantage of the relationship between habitat and 
								morphology in Caribbean anoles and used it to assign mainland species into the Caribbean ecomorphs. We found that 1) many mainland species resemble the Caribbean ecomorphs both ecologically and 
								morphologically, 2) ground-dwelling mainland anoles belong to new a ecomorph class that is uncommon in the Carribbean, and 3) island and mainland anoles are more morphologically 
								similar than previously believed.
								</p>
								<p>There is still a lot left to learn about mainland anoles. Despite our findings, many mainland anoles are morphologically 
								distinct from the established ecomorphs or seemingly represent intermediate ecomorph species. This suggests there may be other ecomorphs waiting to be described or that there are other factors that 
								complicate the evolution of mainland anoles. Because the ecology of mainland anoles is severely understudied compared to their Caribbean counterparts, increasing our knowledge in that arena will 
								surely provide better insights.</p>
